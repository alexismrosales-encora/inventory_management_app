# Frontend - Inventory Management Application

## Overview
This frontend application is built using **React** and **TypeScript**, powered by **Vite**. It provides an intuitive interface for managing inventory products, enabling users to search, filter, add, update, and view inventory data.

## Technologies
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Vitest** for testing
- **Axios**, **Headless UI**, **React Testing Library**, etc.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure **Node.js** (v14 or later) and **npm** (or yarn) are installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the frontend project directory.

## Running the Application
To start the application in development mode, run:
```bash
npm run start
```
This command starts Vite and serves the application on the default port (usually 3000).

## Running Tests
To run all tests using Vitest, execute:
```bash
npm run test
```
This command runs all unit and integration tests and displays the results in the console.

## Building for Production
To build the application for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command compiles the TypeScript code and builds the optimized application using Vite.

## Developer Notes
- The project follows a component-based architecture.
- API calls are made using Axios.
- Maintain consistent code style and follow best practices.
- Tests are written using Vitest and React Testing Library.
- App will run in port 8080
