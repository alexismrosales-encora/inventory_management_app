# Inventory Management Application
This is a project for my first Breakable Toy at the Spark Program.

## Overview
This repository is a monorepo that contains both the **backend** and **frontend** applications for the Inventory Management system.

- **Backend:** Built with Java 17 and Spring Boot. Provides RESTful APIs for inventory management.
- **Frontend:** Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Offers an intuitive interface for managing inventory.
